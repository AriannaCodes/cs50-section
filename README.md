# cs50-section
A repository for code samples from my Fall 2015 section for CS50! Each section has its own folder (so Week 1 materials are in folder 1, Week 2 materials are in folder 2, and so on), in which all the files are contained!

To compile something, run the command:
   clang [filename].c -i [programname]
